# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

REACT JS 2025

 - <React.StrictMode>
  it called the component twice to check is there any erro or not .

 - when component ,nested component even deep nested component get created the only useEffect get called from last component 
 - Component gets called when we make use of it
 - when we just import it create its instance in Ra, and it load all the URL used at top   
 - It mount from bottom to top in reverse order and its fucntionality work in that order as well, useEffect too
 - After last componenet loading their parent cokmponet load and recusively go up
 - whatever we put in the event that get execute , Either it should be function name only or inside function function call 
 - when component level state we change it re-render component with latst state and re-render only nested or deep nested component 
  but it does not call useefect because it does not mount or re-mount 

  - when componenet get removed from DOM tree un-mount function get created
     it must be inside useEffect  return ()=>{
    console.log("Componenet un- Mounted")
        }

  - and when we attached any componenet that comonent get mount and useEffect get executed 

  

  - notes whether we pass component props get changed or component level state changes it re-render only NOT re-mount
   it mount only when it get attached to DOM tree . when it get re-attached again it will get call
